The Caesar cipher is a classic encryption technique used to transform 
plaintext by shifting each letter a fixed number of places down the alphabet. 
Named after Julius Caesar, who reportedly used it for secure communication, 
the cipher replaces each letter with the one a specific number of positions 
later in the alphabet. For example, with a shift of three, 'A' becomes 'D', 
'B' becomes 'E', and so on, wrapping around to the beginning of the alphabet 
for letters at the end. Despite its simplicity and ease of breaking with 
modern computational techniques, the Caesar cipher is significant as an early 
form of cryptography and serves as a foundational concept in the study of secure 
communication.
